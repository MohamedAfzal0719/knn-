🌸 Iris Flower Classification – AI/ML Internship Project (Week 3)
This project was completed as part of my AI & ML Internship with NSP NEXUS.
It involves building a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to classify the species of an Iris flower based on four key features:

🌿 Sepal Length
🌿 Sepal Width
🌺 Petal Length
🌺 Petal Width

🔍 One-Line Description
A classification model built in Python using Google Colab that predicts the Iris flower species using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

📌 Project Overview
This notebook-based project demonstrates a multiclass classification task using the KNN algorithm.
The model uses the built-in Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets which contains the following:
Features:
sepal length
sepal width
petal length
petal width

Target:
species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
The model is trained to classify the species of a flower based on these features.

🎯 Learning Objectives
Understand multiclass classification using K-Nearest Neighbors
Load and explore a built-in dataset using pandas
Visualize species distribution using Seaborn
Train/test split and model evaluation using scikit-learn
Predict Iris species for custom flower measurements

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Google Colab (Notebook)
Python
Libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn

🧪 Sample Dataset
Sepal Length	Sepal Width	Petal Length	Petal Width	Species
5.1	3.5	1.4	0.2	Setosa
7.0	3.2	4.7	1.4	Versicolor
6.3	3.3	6.0	2.5	Virginica

✅ Features Implemented
Data loading from sklearn.datasets
Conversion to pandas DataFrame
Exploratory Data Analysis with Seaborn plots
KNN model training and testing
Accuracy evaluation and confusion matrix visualization
Custom user input support to predict flower species

📎 How to Use This Notebook
Open the notebook in Google Colab
Run all cells step-by-step
In the “User Input Section”, provide:
Sepal Length (e.g., 5.1)
Sepal Width (e.g., 3.5)
Petal Length (e.g., 1.4)
Petal Width (e.g., 0.2)
View the predicted flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica)
